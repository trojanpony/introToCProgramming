//  The first command-line argument, argv[0], as always, will be the command typed to execute that program. The second command-line argument, argv[1], will be the name of an input text file. The third command-line argument, argv[2], will be the name of an output text file.

// The program is to read words from the input text file, and print those words, each enclosed within double quotes and on its own separate line, to the output file. Punctuation marks need not be stripped from words, and you can assume that there are no hyphenated words in the input file. Also, the phrase END-OF-LINE should be printed one a line of its own following each word that is the last word of its line.
